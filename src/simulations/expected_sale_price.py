    Computes the expected sale price.

    *Mean of 2 last prices is chosen if none of the previous prices satisfies the condition.

    This function calculates the expected sale price based on a list of forecasted future prices,
    the purchase price, and specified profit parameters. It considers the probability of a sale on each day,
    where the probability for day $$i$$ is given by:

    $$
    p_i = success\_prob \times prob\_reach\_day
    $$

    where:

    $$
    prob\_reach\_day(i) = \prod_{j=0}^{i-1} (1 - success\_prob)
    $$

    The expected sale price is then computed as:

    $$
    E[P] = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} p_i \cdot P_i + \left( \prod_{i=0}^{n-1}(1 - success\_prob) \right) \cdot P_{n-1}
    $$

    where $$P_i$$ represents the sale price on day $$i$$ after adjustment.


    Parameters
    ----------
    future_prices : List[float]
        A list of forecasted sale prices for each day.
    buy_price : float
        The purchase price used to compute profit percentages.
    min_profit : float
        The minimum required profit percentage (e.g., 0.25 for 25%).
    delta : float
        The daily decrement in the required profit percentage (e.g., 0.01 for a 1% decrease per day).
    success_prob : float
        The probability of a successful sale on any given day (a value between 0 and 1).
    fee : floar
        Ð¡ommission of the platform on which the sale is planned (0.99 for Binance for example)

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The calculated expected sale price.


    Examples
    --------

    >>> expected_price = calculate_expected_sale_price(future_prices, 80, 0.25, 0.01, 0.75)
